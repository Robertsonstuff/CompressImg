# CompressImg
25 lines of code. This is a super handy tool to compress all images both png and jpg in the directory of your choosing to 800 x 800 (which you can easily change on step 6 in the code.). It will also create a folder of your newly compresseed files and put your compressed files in the folder so you don't get mixed up. You'll notice as you run the script it will tell you what images it's compressing in real time. Enjoy!
