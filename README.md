# CompressImg
25 lines of code. This is a super handy tool to compress all images both png and jpg in the current working directory to 800 x 800 (which you can easily change on step 6 in the code.). It will also rename your newly compresseed files so you don't get mixed up and it also tells you what images it's compressing in real time. Enjoy!
